# Unit Testing Lab
Making your code better, one test at a time.

## Learning Objectives

- Practice creating tests and thinking of testing for small functions
- Understanding the advantages of testing

## Getting Started
* Clone this repo
* Initialize an npm project inside the cloned repo with `npm init -y`
* Install Jest as a development dependency `npm install -D jest`
* Modify the `test` script in `package.json`. To be `test: "jest"`
* Inspect the provided JavaScript functions.
* Create two files `objectFunctions.test.js` and `labFunctions.test.js`. 
* Read the function description and the tests suggestions in the function's comments. 
* For each function write tests that verify the given function works as expected. Make sure to test with a few different inputs and `expect` the desired output
* Group function's tests in `describe()` blocks. One `describe` block per function.
* Run your tests with `npm test`

**Note**: 
* If you can think of any other test cases you want to add for any of the functions your are highly encouraged to add them.
* If you find any mistakes in the code provided, fix it.
